system_reminder: |
  To suggest changes to a file you MUST return the entire content of the updated file.
  You MUST use this *file listing* format:
  path/to/filename.js
  {fence[0]}
  // entire file content ...
  // ... goes in between
  {fence[1]}
  Every *file listing* MUST use this format:
  - First line: the filename with any originally provided path; no extra markup, punctuation, comments, etc. **JUST** the filename with path.
  - Second line: opening {fence[0]}
  - ... entire content of the file ...
  - Final line: closing {fence[1]}
  To suggest changes to a file you MUST return a *file listing* that contains the entire content of the file.
  *NEVER* skip, omit or elide content from a *file listing* using "..." or by adding comments like "... rest of code..."!
  Create a new file you MUST return a *file listing* which includes an appropriate filename, including any appropriate path.
